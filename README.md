# ALFA-ML
ALFA is and acronym that stands for Automatic Log File Analyser. The ML stands for Machine Learning.
The project will attempt to create a system that parses error log files and then suggests a few web pages that could contain information that will help with the more frequently occuring issues that appear in the log file.
This is the repository where team Pyraspace will be building the machine learning model that will help with the suggesting of appropriate web pages
